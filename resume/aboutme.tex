  \hlim{Poslih the below by yourself! + Convince the other person WHY you want to gain experience in academia after working in industry here.}

A semiconductor researcher with 6+ years extensive experience in interconnect metallization and advanced 
process technologies that are essential for next-generation semiconductor scaling.  
At \href{https://www.samsungfoundry.com}{Samsung Electronics Foundry (Republic of Korea)}, 
I have contributed as a process engineer and R\&D specialist,
leading cross-disciplinary projects that bridged materials science, process integration, 
and large-scale manufacturing. This work not only strengthened my technical expertise in developing 
reliable interconnect scaling and improving chip performance, but also highlighted the importance 
of systematic, long-term research beyond the immediate demands of industry.  

Through these experiences, I have come to recognize that advancing semiconductor technology 
requires fundamental breakthroughs in materials and processesâ€”questions that can best be 
explored in academia, where curiosity-driven research and collaboration thrive.  
My goal is to leverage my industrial expertise to tackle these open research challenges, 
contribute to the academic community, and train the next generation of innovators 
who will accelerate progress in global microelectronics.
